"I have done this assignment completely on my own. I have not copied
it, nor have I given my solution to anyone else. I understand that if
I am involved in plagiarism or cheating I will have to sign an
official form that I have cheated and that this form will be stored in
my official university record. I also understand that I will receive a
grade of 0 for the involved assignment for my first offense and that I
will receive a grade of F for the course for any additional
offense.‚Äù

Provide justification for Data Structures used in this assignment in
term of Big O complexity (time and/or space)

Student ArrayList, Time complexity for insert is O(1) which is useful because of the amount of inserting into this list.
An arrayList was chosen over a vector or an array because the number of students could be variable in the future, even though it
was static for this assignment. Also we did not expect to be a large variability in the number of students, which is why we chose the 
array list because it doesn't double in size like a vector, in an effort to remain space efficient.

Student scheduledCourses ArrayList, Time Complexity for insert is O(1)

Student coursePreference Array, Time complexity for access is O(1)

Course courseList Array, Time complexity for access is O(1)
